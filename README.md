## Information

Atlas creates portable ZIP backups of browser profiles while not writing to any browser directory, ever.

## Features

- Supports 300+ Chromium, Gecko, and legacy browser variants.
- Excludes caches and temporary data, often reducing a 1 GB+ profile to about 100 MB while preserving settings, history, and bookmarks.
- Uses a strictly read-only source model and atomically creates ZIP archives in a user-selected location.
- Supports Windows (NT), Linux, and BSD kernel platforms (Windows 7 through 11, Linux with glibc 2.31+, and FreeBSD/GhostBSD), with native Windows portable executables, Linux AppImages, Debian packages, FreeBSD pkg packages, and Python-package installs.
- CI builds the Linux payload and runs Atlas tests in a network-disabled container; startup networking attempts fail the build.

## Privacy & Offline Guarantee

Atlas is engineered from the ground up as an offline-first tool that respects user privacy:

- **100% Offline:** Zero telemetry, zero analytics, zero crash reporting, and zero cloud synchronization.
- **Physical Network Exclusion:** Standalone executable builds physically exclude standard Python and Qt networking libraries (`socket`, `ssl`, `http`, `QtNetwork`).
- **Read-Only Operation:** Live browser folders are opened strictly in read-only mode and are never modified, written to, or deleted.
- **No Password Decryption:** Atlas does not decrypt DPAPI credentials, master keys, or saved browser passwords.
- **Local Control:** All archives remain on your local drive and are completely under your ownership and control.

For full details, see the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6 6.0+ (PyQt5 is the fallback for Windows 7)
- Linux builds: glibc 2.31+; Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is the preferred baseline
- FreeBSD/GhostBSD builds require system Python and Qt packages (`py312-qt6-pyqt` etc.)

For Linux or FreeBSD builds, first run:

```bash
# If using fish, switch to bash or zsh first: bash
source scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

The setup script requires a POSIX-compliant shell (`bash` or `zsh`). It checks XCB/XWayland libraries for reliable Qt startup and automatically configures safe virtual environments matching the system Python version on BSD.

## Install and run

```bash
pip install .
atlas
```

For purely headless terminal usage (e.g. SSH sessions, cron jobs, or safe mode) you can bypass the graphical UI entirely:

```bash
atlas --cli
atlas --version
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m atlas.main
```

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

For headless Linux or CI execution:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest
```

## Build

### Windows portable executable

```bash
pyinstaller main.spec
```

The output is `dist/Atlas-x86_64-Portable.exe` for a 64-bit Python build or
`dist/Atlas-x86-Portable.exe` for a 32-bit build. The Inno Setup installer
uses the matching file automatically and installs it without `-Portable`.

### Linux AppImage

```bash
bash scripts/build_appimage.sh
```

This creates `dist/Atlas-<architecture>.AppImage` from an onedir payload, avoiding PyInstaller one-file extraction at launch. If `appimagetool` is absent, the script asks before downloading it to `~/.local/bin`; declining or a failed download still leaves a ready-to-package AppDir at `dist/Atlas.AppDir`.

Linux uses `assets/icons/Icon.svg` for the application and AppImage icon.

### Debian/Ubuntu package

```bash
bash scripts/build_deb.sh
```

This creates an artifact such as `dist/Atlas-x86_64.deb`, matching the
AppImage naming scheme. It reuses the same Linux onedir payload as the
AppImage, keeps Atlas under `/opt/atlas`, and adds only the normal launcher
and desktop-entry integration files. `dpkg-deb` is required (it is normally
provided by the `dpkg` package).

Install a built package with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./dist/Atlas-x86_64.deb
```

### FreeBSD pkg package

```bash
bash scripts/build_pkg.sh
```

This creates an artifact such as `dist/Atlas-amd64.pkg`. It extracts the same
PyInstaller payload into a native FreeBSD package, registers the XDG
desktop icon natively, and binds to `/usr/local/`.

Install a built package with:

```bash
sudo pkg add ./dist/Atlas-amd64.pkg
```

### FreeBSD/GhostBSD portable executable

If distributing a standalone portable binary, use the included installer script to bypass strict `.pkg` architecture mismatch errors across major FreeBSD releases. Package `Atlas-x86_64-Portable`, `Icon.svg`, and `scripts/install_bsd.sh` into a single zip file. Users extract it and run:

```bash
sh install_bsd.sh
```

*(Note: Do not use the `source` command to run this installer, as it replaces the current process with `sudo` and will terminate your interactive shell).*

This handles dependency checks (e.g. `compat13x-amd64` for older binaries on newer operating systems) and integrates the app natively into `/usr/local/`.
