## Information

Atlas creates portable ZIP backups of browser profiles while not writing to any browser directory, ever.

## Features

- Supports 250+ Chromium, Gecko, and legacy browser variants.
- Excludes caches and temporary data, often reducing a 1 GB+ profile to about 100 MB while preserving settings, history, and bookmarks.
- Uses a strictly read-only source model and atomically creates ZIP archives in a user-selected location.
- Supports Windows 7 through 11, Linux (glibc 2.31+), Windows portable executables, Linux AppImage and Debian packages, and Python-package installs.
- CI builds the Linux payload and runs Atlas tests in a network-disabled container; startup networking attempts fail the build.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyQt6 6.0+ (PyQt5 is the fallback for Windows 7)
- Linux builds: glibc 2.31+; Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is the preferred baseline

For Linux builds, first run:

```bash
source scripts/setup_dev.sh
```

The setup script checks XCB/XWayland libraries for reliable Qt startup and asks before installing missing dependencies.

## Install and run

```bash
pip install .
atlas
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m atlas.main
```

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

For headless Linux or CI execution:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest
```

## Build

### Windows portable executable

```bash
pyinstaller main.spec
```

The output is `dist/Atlas-x86_64-Portable.exe` for a 64-bit Python build or
`dist/Atlas-x86-Portable.exe` for a 32-bit build. The Inno Setup installer
uses the matching file automatically and installs it without `-Portable`.

### Linux AppImage

```bash
bash scripts/build_appimage.sh
```

This creates `dist/Atlas-<architecture>.AppImage` from an onedir payload, avoiding PyInstaller one-file extraction at launch. If `appimagetool` is absent, the script asks before downloading it to `~/.local/bin`; declining or a failed download still leaves a ready-to-package AppDir at `dist/Atlas.AppDir`.

Linux uses `assets/icons/Icon.svg` for the application and AppImage icon.

### Debian/Ubuntu package

```bash
bash scripts/build_deb.sh
```

This creates an artifact such as `dist/Atlas-x86_64.deb`, matching the
AppImage naming scheme. It reuses the same Linux onedir payload as the
AppImage, keeps Atlas under `/opt/atlas`, and adds only the normal launcher
and desktop-entry integration files. `dpkg-deb` is required (it is normally
provided by the `dpkg` package).

Install a built package with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./dist/Atlas-x86_64.deb
```
