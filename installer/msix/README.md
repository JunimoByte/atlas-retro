Key Features:
• Supports 300+ Chromium, Gecko, and legacy browser variants (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Zen, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.).
• Smart Exclusion: Automatically strips caches, shader caches, and temporary download files, drastically reducing archive sizes.

## 2. Notes for Certification (For the Microsoft Tester)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copy and paste this exact text into the **"Notes for certification"** text box in the Microsoft Partner Center during submission:

```text
TESTER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Atlas is a desktop utility that detects locally installed web browsers (such as Microsoft Edge, Chrome, or Firefox) and backs up their profile folders into standard .zip files in the user's Downloads folder.
2. No login credentials, cloud accounts, or hardware keys are required to test the application.
3. To test:
   a. Launch the application.
   b. The application will scan and show the estimated backup size of detected local browsers.
   c. Click "OK" to begin backup.
   d. The progress bar will update and complete, saving standard .zip files to your local Downloads\Backup directory.
   e. Click "Open Folder" to view the generated archives, or "Cancel" to close.

SECURITY & PERMISSION DISCLOSURE:
• Restricted Capability (runFullTrust): Required to read standard user configuration directories (%APPDATA% and %LOCALAPPDATA%) where web browsers store local profiles.
• 100% Offline Architecture: The application makes zero network requests. The binary packaging specification explicitly blocks and strips all networking libraries (socket, ssl, http, QtNetwork) from the runtime.
• No Password Decryption: Atlas does not crack or decrypt DPAPI credentials or master passwords. Files are copied directly into standard compressed archives.
• Read-Only Access: Original browser directories are never written to, altered, or deleted.
```

## 3. Restricted Capability Justification (`runFullTrust`)

During submission under the **App capabilities** or **Package submission** section, Microsoft requires an explanation for declaring `rescap:runFullTrust`:

> **Question:** Why does your application require the `runFullTrust` capability?
>
> **Copy & Paste Answer:**
> *"Atlas is a Win32 desktop utility packaged via Desktop Bridge. The `runFullTrust` capability is strictly required to enumerate and read standard local browser configuration directories in `%APPDATA%` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (e.g. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data`) to generate user-initiated backup archives. The application operates strictly offline, does not modify source files, and does not perform network access."*

## 5. Finding Your Publisher ID in Partner Center

Your Publisher ID is required in `AppxManifest.xml` (`Publisher="CN=..."`).
1. In Partner Center, click the **Gear Icon (Settings)** at the top right.
2. Navigate to **Account settings > Legal info > Developer tab**.
3. Under **Seller ID / Publisher ID**, copy your exact **CN** string (e.g., `CN=12345678-ABCD-EF01-2345-6789ABCDEF01`).
4. Replace `CN=YOUR-PUBLISHER-ID-FROM-PARTNER-CENTER` in `installer/msix/AppxManifest.xml`.

## 6. Packaging for Official Store Upload

### Prerequisites
* Windows SDK (`makeappx.exe` located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\<version>\x64`).

### Build & Package Steps
1. **Build Windows Executable:**
   ```powershell
   python -m PyInstaller main.spec --noconfirm
   ```
2. **Stage Directory (`dist/msix_store_stage/`):**
   * Copy `AppxManifest.xml` (with your real `CN=...` Publisher ID).
   * Copy `dist/Atlas-x86_64-Portable.exe` as `dist/msix_store_stage/Atlas.exe`.
   * Copy `installer/msix/Assets/` to `dist/msix_store_stage/Assets/`.
3. **Pack into MSIX:**
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.26100.0\x64\makeappx.exe" pack /d dist/msix_store_stage /p dist/Atlas-1.2.0.0-Release.msix /o
   ```
4. **Upload:**
   * In Partner Center > Apps > Atlas > Packages, upload `dist/Atlas-1.2.0.0-Release.msix`.
   * *Note: Do NOT sign the Release package locally; Microsoft signs it automatically with their trusted Store root upon passing certification.*
